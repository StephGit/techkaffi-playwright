# Key Differences

| **Feature** | **Playwright**	| **Cypress** |
| :----------- | :------ | :------ |
| üìù *Language*	| JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C# |	JavaScript, TypeScript |
| üèÉüèΩ *Test Runner*	| Works with Jest, Mocha, and others	| Built-in test runner
| ‚õìÔ∏è *Parallel Testing*	| Full parallelism, even within specs |	Parallel at spec level only |
| ‚õ©Ô∏è *Architecture* | Uses browser contexts for isolation |	Runs within the browser itself |
| üï∏Ô∏è *Browsers Supported* |	Chromium, Firefox, WebKit	| Chrome, Edge (Chromium-based) |
| üì± *Real Devices Support* |	Limited |	No |

<!--

## Cypress

```js
describe('example to-do app', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/todo')
  })

  it('displays two todo items by default', () => {
    cy.get('.todo-list li').should('have.length', 2)
    cy.get('.todo-list li').first().should('have.text', 'Pay electric bill')
    cy.get('.todo-list li').last().should('have.text', 'Walk the dog')
  })
```

::right::

## Playwright

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has list with two items by default', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.cypress.io/todo');
  expect(page.locator('.todo-list li')).toHaveCount(2);
  expect(page.locator('.todo-list li')).toHaveText(['Pay electric bill', 'Walk the dog']);
});
```

# Special Attacks

Async
Testrecording

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('Multiple API Requests Test', async ({ request }) => {
  // First request and assertion
  const todoResponse = await request.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  expect(todoResponse.status()).toBe(200)

  // Second request and assertion
  const userResponse = await request.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
  expect(userResponse.status()).toBe(200)
})
```
