# Comprehensive Playwright vs Cypress Comparison Table

Use this table in your slides for a complete comparison between the frameworks:

```markdown
| **Feature** | **Playwright** | **Cypress** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| 📝 **Language** | JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C# | JavaScript, TypeScript |
| 🏃🏽 **Test Runner** | Works with Jest, Mocha, and others | Built-in test runner with time-travel debugging |
| ⛓️ **Parallel Testing** | Full parallelism, even within specs | Parallel at spec level only (paid plans for optimal performance) |
| ⛩️ **Architecture** | Node.js context separate from browser | Runs within the browser itself |
| 🕸️ **Browsers Supported** | Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari), Edge | Chrome, Firefox, Edge (Chromium-based), Electron (Safari experimental) |
| 📱 **Mobile Testing** | Emulation + limited real device support | Emulation only with limited options |
| 📄 **Test Syntax** | `async/await` with explicit promises | Chainable commands with implicit waiting |
| 🖼️ **iframes** | Native support | Requires plugins or custom commands |
| 🪟 **Multiple tabs/windows** | Supported | Limited support |
| 🌐 **Network Interception** | Route-based with flexible handlers | Powerful `cy.intercept()` API |
| 🔄 **Auto-waiting** | Intelligent waiting for actionable elements | Built-in retry-ability and automatic waiting |
| 🧩 **Component Testing** | Framework-agnostic | Supports React, Vue, Angular, Svelte |
| 🔍 **Debugging** | Inspector, tracing, screenshots, videos | Time-travel debugging with DOM snapshots |
| 📊 **Reporting** | Built-in HTML reporter | Dashboard service (paid feature) |
| 🔌 **Plugin Ecosystem** | Growing ecosystem | Mature, extensive ecosystem |
| 🎬 **Record & Playback** | Mature codegen tool with multi-language support | Experimental Cypress Studio feature |
```

## Key Takeaways for Slides

- **Playwright Strengths**: Cross-browser support (including Safari), multiple language bindings, flexible architecture
- **Cypress Strengths**: Developer experience, built-in test runner, mature ecosystem
- **Major Differences**: Browser support, execution model, iframe handling
- **Decision Factors**: Safari testing needs, language requirements, debugging preferences
